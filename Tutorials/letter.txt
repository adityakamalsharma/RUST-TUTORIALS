Subject: Request for a Personal Meeting Regarding Age Relaxation Approval for Compassionate Appointment

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally request an in-person meeting with you regarding my pending compassionate appointment at EPFO, following the unfortunate demise of my husband, Late Shri Kamal Kishore Sharma, who was serving at EPFO, Shimla. He passed away on 15th July 2023, and as per the applicable rules, I am entitled to a job on compassionate grounds.

However, despite my application, my appointment has been delayed due to the pending approval of the age relaxation requirement. As I am 44 years old, I require an official age relaxation to qualify for the position. Unfortunately, my request has been stuck for over one and a half years, causing immense uncertainty and distress for my family.

Additionally, we were allotted official accommodation for two years following my husband's passing, which is set to expire on 15th July 2025. With my employment still pending, the situation has become even more concerning for us.

Given the urgency of the matter, I kindly request a personal meeting at the EPFO Headquarters in Delhi to discuss this issue and seek your assistance in expediting the approval process. I would be grateful if you could provide me with a suitable date and time for this meeting at your earliest convenience.

I sincerely request your support and intervention to ensure that the rightful process is completed without further delay. Kindly let me know how I can proceed further. I can be reached at +91- 7650024943 or iadityakamalsharma@gmail.com for any updates or clarification.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your kind response.

Yours sincerely,
Anjna Kumari
